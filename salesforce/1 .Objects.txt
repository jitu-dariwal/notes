Object   : 
==================================================================================
	1.Objects are nothing but tables in the regular database .
	
	2.Any data stored in the salesforce will be saved to objects.
	
	3.There are two types of objects 
		a. Standard Objects .
		b. Custom Objects 
		
	4.Standard Objects : 
		a. Objects which are created by the salesforce  are called standard objects.
		Ex : Account,Contact,User,Profile ,UserRole,Lead,Opportunity
		
		b.Standard Objects cannot be deleted .
		
		c.Standard objects can be customized .
		
	5.Custom Objects :
		a. These are the objects created by user to meet his organizational business
			reqirement.
   
		b. All the custom objects are appended with __C 
			Ex : Customer__c , Loan__c ,Payment__c .
			
	6. Steps to create Custom Objects
 
		a. Navigation 
			
		Setup   
			|---Build
				    |---Create
						    |---Objects 
									 |---New Custom Objects
									 
	Step 1 : Enter Object Label  
         Example : Customer
		 
	Note : Objects are  displayed on the User Interface with object Label
	
    Step 2: Enter Pural Label    
         Example : Customers
	Note : If we create a tab for this object ,Name that should be displayed 
                       on the tab is called pural Label
					   
	Step 3: Enter Object Name 
         Example : Customer
	Note : If you want to refer to object Programatically we use object Name.
   
	Step 4: Context sensitive help
	
       1. On Every object salesforce provides helpforthispage Link . 
	   
       2. When we click on the link which document should be opened is defined 
          using this settings 
      
      a. Open the standard Salesforce.com Help & Training window.
         If this option is selected salesforce standard document will be
         opened
		 
      b.Open a window using a Visualforce page .
         If we choose this option we can create our own visualforce page as
         help document.
		 
	Step 5:: Record Name Label and DataType 
	
      a. Salesforce by defualt on every custom object creates one 
         standard field with name " Name"
 
      b. With what label this field should be displayed ,that name we 
         define as Record Name Label
		 
      c. This is a required field 
	  
      d. This will accept the datatypes of Text and AutoNumber.
	  
      e. If we choose the data type as Text ,This will alphanumeric data .
	  
      f. If we choose the data Type as Autonumber, Then system will  generate 
         the data in the format what we have specified .
      
         Ex :
         Format  : INVNO{0000}
         Start      : 0
         INVNO0001
         INVN00002
         INVNO0003
         Format : OR-{000}
         Start     : 501
         OR-501
         OR-502
         Format : {mm}{dd}{000}
         Start      :1
         1029001
         1029002
		 
	Step 6: Optional Features :
			These options can be enabled or disabled at any stage of the application
			
       a.Allow Reports    	: If you enable this option ,we can create reports 
                             on the data which is available in the object.
 
       b.Allow Activities   : If you enable this option we can create Events 
                             and Tasks on this object .
                
      c.Track Field History : If you enable this option we can track the 
                              changes made on the fields of this object.
 
       d.Allow in chatter Group: If you enable this option we can create 
                                 chatter groups on this object.
								 
	Step 7: Object Classification :
      
      a. Allow Sharing
      b. Allow Bulk API Access
      c. Allow Streaming API Access
	  
      Note : if we enable all the  three options then it is Enterprise 
              Application object.
			  
      Note : If we disable any one of this option we call it as Lightning 
             application object.
			 
	Step 8 : Deployment Status :
	
			In Development  : If we enable this option  only Adminstrator will be 
					able to access this object ,no other user can see this object .
			
			Deployed        : If we enable this option  All the users in the 
								organization can access this object based on 
								security model of the organization.
   
	Step 9: Allow Search    :
	
      If we enable this option  content of this object can be searched 
	  from global search.
	  
	Step 10: Object Creation Option :
			These options can be enabled or disabled only at the time of creating an object.
			
      a. Add Notes and Attachments related list to default page layout.
      b. Launch New Custom Tab Wizard after saving this custom object.
